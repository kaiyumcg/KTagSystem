# KTagSystem
Relational Tag system for unity games. So you can have cow, sahiwal and wagyu tags and then have sahiwal and wagyu to be child tag of cow tag! Currently uses plain scriptable objects, I will use xNode to mode stuffs into a node based tag definition file. Very early stage prototype of an aspiring advaned tag system. Unity version: 2020.3.3f1 or up
